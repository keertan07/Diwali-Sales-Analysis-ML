Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Diwali Sales dataset using Python


# Diwali Sales Analysis (EDA Project)

Hi there!   
This is a data analysis project I worked on to explore sales patterns during the Diwali festival. The goal was to understand customer behavior, identify high-performing segments, and extract useful business insights — all using Python and basic data analysis techniques.



##  What this project is about

I used a dataset containing customer purchase data from a Diwali campaign. It includes information like gender, age, occupation, state, amount spent, and more. The main focus of the project was **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — no machine learning models here, just understanding the data through visualization and statistics.



##  Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data wrangling  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – to run and document everything



##  Key Insights Discovered

- **Women aged 26–35** were the top spenders during Diwali
- **Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka** were the highest-performing states
- **Married individuals** tended to spend more than singles
- Occupations like **IT and healthcare** had strong spending patterns

*(I’ve added some graphs in the notebook to support these points.)*
